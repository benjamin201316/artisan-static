The physical side effects after an abortion can vary from woman to woman and there are potential side effects and risks that you should be aware of.

# 

It is important to talk to a health professional as well as the doctor who will perform your abortion about possible side effects.

# 

# 

Your period should return about 4-6 weeks after the abortion, and you can get pregnant again soon after the abortion.



If your doctor has prescribed antibiotics, it is important to take them as directed in order to help prevent infection.
